0.7.0 (2020-07-26)
------------------
* Replace the default inverse gamma distribution prior for the lengthscales by the round-flat distribution.
* Fix ``guess_priors`` to correctly add kernels with multiple lengthscales.

0.6.0 (2020-05-21)
------------------

* Add ``Optimizer.expected_optimality_gap`` which estimates the expected optimality gap of the current global optimum
  to random optima sampled from the Gaussian process.
* Check that the list of priors has the correct length.
* Require emcee to be at least version 3.0.

0.5.0 (2020-05-21)
------------------

* Add ``Optimizer.probability_of_optimality`` which estimates the probability that the current global optimum is
  optimal within a certain tolerance. This can be used to make stopping rules.

0.4.1 (2020-05-19)
------------------

* Update and fix dependencies.

0.4.0 (2020-04-27)
------------------

* Add ``return_policy`` parameter to ``BayesSearchCV``. Allows the user to choose between returning the best
  observed configuration (in a noise-less setting) or the best predicted configuration (for noisy targets).

0.3.3 (2020-03-16)
------------------

* Fix error occuring when an unknown argument was passed to ``Optimizer``.

0.3.0 (2020-03-12)
------------------

* Add predictive variance reduction search criterion. This is the new default
  acquisition function.
* Implement ``BayesSearchCV`` for use with scikit-learn estimators and
  pipelines. This is an easy to use drop-in replacement for GridSearchCV or
  RandomSearchCV. It is implemented as a wrapper around skopt.BayesSearchCV.
* Determine default kernels and priors to use, if the user provides none.
* Add example notebooks on how to use the library.
* Add API documentation of the library.


0.2.0 (2020-03-01)
------------------

* Allow user to pass a vector of noise variances to ``tell``, ``fit`` and ``sample``.
  This can be used to warm start the optimization process.

0.1.2 (2020-02-16)
------------------

* Fix the ``tell`` method of the optimizer not updating ``_n_initial_points`` correctly,
  when using replace.

0.1.0 (2020-02-01)
------------------

* First release on PyPI.
